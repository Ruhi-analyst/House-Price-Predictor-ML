#Project Overview
The House Price Prediction project involves creating a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, and other relevant attributes. The project includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing.
Model training and evaluation.
A web interface for users to input data and receive predictions

Usage
To use the House Price Prediction project, follow these steps:

Prepare the data:

Ensure cleaned_data.csv is in the project directory.
The dataset should contain the necessary features for model training.

Train the model:

Run Prediction Project.ipynb to train the machine learning model using the provided dataset.
This will create a serialized model file (e.g., model.pkl).

Start the Flask application:
python Model_pycharm.py

This will start a local server on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Access the web interface:

Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Use the interface to input data and get house price predictions.
